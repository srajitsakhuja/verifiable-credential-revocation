# Revocation and Suspension of Verifiable Credentials
The revocation and suspension of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are important use cases. This repository stores code that experiments with different revocation data structures, and proposes the infrastructure layer for VC revocation and suspension.

In this repository, we implement two services - the Membership Management Service (MMS) and the Membership Checking Service (MCS). The MMS is expected to be run and managed by the party issuing the VCs and the MCS can be operated by any actor wanting to verify a VC. VC verification in this context mainly pertains to checking if it is revoked/suspended or not. The MMS helps the issuer manage the lifecycle of a VC by supporting operations to add, revoke, unrevoke VCs.
